#                   Gain set to 18, resolution set to 16 bit, integration time is 25 ms
#                   Values may range from 0 to 65535, expected no larger than 3000
#       1b. Ambient light counts on the sensor
#           NOTES:  Reference: https://optoelectronics.liteon.com/upload/download/DS86-2015-0004/LTR-390UV_Final_%20DS_V1%201.pdf
#                   Gain set to 1, resolution set to 16 bit, integration time is 25 ms
#                   Values may range from 0 to 65535
#                   Counts are compressed with a formula log10(al_counts + 1000) * 139 - 417 and sent as an unsigned 8 bit integer
#                   Counts are decompressed by the ground station
#                   Decompression formula is 10^((received_counts + 417) / 139) - 1000
#                   Decompressed values are stored as unisgned 16 bit integers
#       1c. Magnetic field on the probe in x-direction, normalized to total magnitude equal to 1
#       1d. Magnetic field on the probe in y-direction, normalized to total magnitude equal to 1
#       1e. Magnetic field on the probe in z-direction, normalized to total magnitude equal to 1
#           NOTES:  Magnetic field is an average of 10 samples measured right before 1a and another 10 samples after 1b
#                   Values are interpolated as an average of all the samples
#       1f. Timestamp at the beginning of the frame
#           NOTES:  First 10 magnetometer samples are obtained up to 10ms from the timestamp
#                   Ultraviolet counts are sampled in the window between 1 to 26ms from the timestamp
#                   Ambient light counts are sampled in the window between 27 and 52ms from the timestamp
#                   Last 10 magnetometer samples are obtained 62ms from the timestamp
#                   Timestamp given in the format hh:mm:ss.sss
#       NOTES: All the points 1a-1f are repeated four times for each sensor
#  2. GPS frame
#       2a. Longitude of the probe in degree east
#       2b. Longitude of the probe in arcminutes east from the last full degree

#       2f. Latitude of the probe in arcseconds east from the last full arcminute
#       2g. Altitude in meters above sea level
#       2h. Timestamp of the GPS data frame
#       NOTES:  Received GPS data is sent in clipped compressed values thus overflow errors can occur
#               Overflow spherical coordinates error occurs for every 18°12'18''
#               Overflow altitudinal error occurs for every 65 536 m
#               Overflow temporal error occurs for every 18 hours, 12 minutes and 18 seconds
#               Expected launch coordinates are 69°19' N, 16°7' E
#               Expected launch time is 23-04-2024 between 12:45:00 - 15:00:00 UTC
#               Expected altitude is from 0 to 30 000 m above sea level
#  9. Barometric altitude
#       NOTES:  In meters above sea level based on CanSat book from Andøya Space Education

#       NOTES:  Given in degrees Celsius
#               Overflow error occurs for every 128 degrees
#               Values ranging from -84 to +43.5
#               Expected temperature is from -70 to +30
